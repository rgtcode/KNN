# KNN
Here K-Nearest Neighbour have used for the classification task for several datasets
For performing Classification using KNN we find out the nearest neighbour of the test data from the training data.To measure the nearness we use different distance measure.For the case of Image and Synthetic Data we used simple Euclidean distance and for the handwritten and speech data we used DTW distance as the measure.Once all the distance are found select top K neighbours and whichever class is having majority examples in K neighbours will be the actural class

##Dataset Used
1. Speech Data.
2. Handwritten Data.
3. Image Data
4. Synthetic Data.
